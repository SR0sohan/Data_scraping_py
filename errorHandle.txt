The code uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape data from a website. The requests library is used to send an HTTP request to the website and retrieve the HTML content of the page. The BeautifulSoup library is then used to parse the HTML content and extract the data.

First, the code imports the necessary libraries and creates an empty dictionary named data. This dictionary will be used to store the scraped data.

import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

data = {"product name": [], "Description": [], "price": [], "Reviews": []}


Next, the code uses a for loop to iterate over a range of page numbers. For each page number, the code constructs a URL by appending the page number to a base URL. The requests.get() function is then used to send an HTTP GET request to this URL and retrieve the HTML content of the page.

for i in range(2, 8):
    url = 'https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=mobile+under+55000rs&otracker=search&otracker1=search&marketplace=FLIPKART&as-show=on&as=off&augment=false&page=' + \
        str(i)
    r = requests.get(url)
The BeautifulSoup constructor is then used to create a soup object from the HTML content. This object provides several methods for searching and navigating the HTML tree structure.

soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'lxml')
The soup.find_all() method is used to find all div elements with a class attribute of _2kHMtA. These elements represent rows of data on the website. The method returns a list of Tag objects, which are then iterated over using a nested for loop.

rows = soup.find_all('div', class_="_2kHMtA")

for row in rows:
For each row of data, the code uses the row.find() method to find specific elements within that row. For example, to extract the product name, the code searches for a div element with a class attribute of _4rR01T. If such an element is found, its text content is appended to the "product name" list in the data dictionary. If no such element is found, an empty string is appended instead.

name = row.find('div', class_="_4rR01T")
if name:
    data["product name"].append(name.text)
else:
    data["product name"].append('')
The same process is repeated for each column of data (description, price, and reviews). The code searches for specific elements within each row and extracts their text content. If an element is not found, an empty string is appended instead.

desc = row.find('ul', class_="_1xgFaf")
if desc:
    data["Description"].append(desc.text)
else:
    data["Description"].append('')

price = row.find('div', class_="_30jeq3 _1_WHN1")
if price:
    data["price"].append(price.text)
else:
    data["price"].append('')

review = row.find('div', class_="_3LWZlK")
if review:
    data["Reviews"].append(review.text)
else:
    data["Reviews"].append('')
After all pages have been scraped and all data has been extracted, the code creates a DataFrame from the data dictionary using the pd.DataFrame() constructor. The DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file named testone.csv using the df.to_csv() method.

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('testone.csv')
This is how the code works. It scrapes data from multiple pages of a website and stores it in a DataFrame. The DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis. I hope this explanation helps you understand how the code works!

Received message. Sure! Here's an explanation of how the code works: The code uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to scrape data from a website. The `requests` library is used to send an HTTP request to the website and retrieve the HTML content of the page. The `BeautifulSoup` library is then used to parse the HTML content and extract the data. First, the code imports the necessary libraries and creates an empty dictionary named `data`. This dictionary will be used to store the scraped data. ```python import pandas as pd from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests data = {"product name": [], "Description": [], "price": [], "Reviews": []} ``` Next, the code uses a `for` loop to iterate over a range of page numbers. For each page number, the code constructs a URL by appending the page number to a base URL. The `requests.get()` function is then used to send an HTTP GET request to this URL and retrieve the HTML content of the page. ```python for i in range(2, 8): url = 'https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=mobile+under+55000rs&otracker=search&otracker1=search&marketplace=FLIPKART&as-show=on&as=off&augment=false&page=' + \ str(i) r = requests.get(url) ``` The `BeautifulSoup` constructor is then used to create a `soup` object from the HTML content. This object provides several methods for searching and navigating the HTML tree structure. ```python soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'lxml') ``` The `soup.find_all()` method is used to find all `div` elements with a class attribute of `_2kHMtA`. These elements represent rows of data on the website. The method returns a list of `Tag` objects, which are then iterated over using a nested `for` loop. ```python rows = soup.find_all('div', class_="_2kHMtA") for row in rows: ``` For each row of data, the code uses the `row.find()` method to find specific elements within that row. For example, to extract the product name, the code searches for a `div` element with a class attribute of `_4rR01T`. If such an element is found, its text content is appended to the `"product name"` list in the `data` dictionary. If no such element is found, an empty string is appended instead. ```python name = row.find('div', class_="_4rR01T") if name: data["product name"].append(name.text) else: data["product name"].append('') ``` The same process is repeated for each column of data (description, price, and reviews). The code searches for specific elements within each row and extracts their text content. If an element is not found, an empty string is appended instead. ```python desc = row.find('ul', class_="_1xgFaf") if desc: data["Description"].append(desc.text) else: data["Description"].append('') price = row.find('div', class_="_30jeq3 _1_WHN1") if price: data["price"].append(price.text) else: data["price"].append('') review = row.find('div', class_="_3LWZlK") if review: data["Reviews"].append(review.text) else: data["Reviews"].append('') ``` After all pages have been scraped and all data has been extracted, the code creates a DataFrame from the `data` dictionary using the `pd.DataFrame()` constructor. The DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file named `testone.csv` using the `df.to_csv()` method. ```python df = pd.DataFrame(data) df.to_csv('testone.csv') ``` This is how the code works. It scrapes data from multiple pages of a website and stores it in a DataFrame. The DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis.
